# StatisticalMachineLearning
Just a simple course project. 

### Main task 

Here we try to do a supervised learning over video data. 
The video feature has been extracted using some mysterious deep learning method, may be. 
And we are artificially required to use some statistical machine learning methods to play with these fixed feature.

### Methodology 

We are required to use 3 statistical machine learning methods and 1 deep learning method. 
We are required to do 2 clever model selection method. 

### Progress 

1. First we just do a random train-test split to assess our model. 
2. First we write a simple rnn. 
3. I realize that this project is quite simple, we just play around with sklearn model.
    I believe that the first thing to do is to do a dimensionality reduction, and then we fit something.
4. We first do a linear regression. We can find that a linear regression just gives us an accuracy of 85%, which is 
    already pretty good.
5. We then try to use feature selection to reduce the classification variance.
